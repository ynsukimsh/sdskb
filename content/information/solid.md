# About SOLID Design System

SOLID DS is a good design system and this site is documentation for it.

## Getting started

Use the sidebar to explore **foundations**, **components**, and **UI patterns**. Each section includes:

- Clear guidelines and usage
- Do's and don'ts where applicable
- Links to Figma when available

## Key principles

1. **Consistency** — Use tokens and components from the system.
2. **Accessibility** — Meet contrast and interaction standards.
3. **Documentation** — Keep this site up to date as the system evolves.

> This design system helps product and engineering teams build cohesive, accessible experiences.

For questions or contributions, reach out to the design system team.
